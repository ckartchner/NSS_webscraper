# NSS_webscraper

In 2011, motivated by frustration and curiosity, I decided to write a webscraper that would help me collect and organize information about the National Speleoligical Society (NSS). 

The basic concept was to download all the data I could about the various NSS internal organizations and format it in a more digestable manner. I then fomatted that data into CSV files. Beyond just reviewing the data in the CSVs, I comverted them to KML files for use in Google Earth. I also created a google maps page with the data. 
This resulting data was then shared on a blog I created for the purpose of showcasing this data.

Today, in early 2018, the NSS IO database is offline so I have no way to update these scripts to verify they still work. 
If I find a little free time, and the IO committee ever gets their act together, I'd like to dust these scripts off, and see what has changed with the organization. 

I also wrote these scripts before I had discovered version control for my personal development so I'm not 100% sure everything here is the final version.
